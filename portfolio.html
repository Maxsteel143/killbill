                    <h2>Gas Detection IoT Project</h2>
                    <p>The gas detection IoT project aims to create a comprehensive system for monitoring air quality in real-time. 
                        The project involves integrating gas sensors with a microcontroller, such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi, to measure concentrations of various gases. 
                        The collected data is then transmitted to a cloud platform using wireless communication protocols like MQTT or HTTP, enabling centralized monitoring.
                         An alert mechanism is implemented to notify relevant parties in the event of gas levels exceeding predefined thresholds. The project also includes a user-friendly interface, 
                         either web-based or mobile, for visualizing the real-time data, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into gas levels and trends,
                          facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing overall safety measures.</p>
